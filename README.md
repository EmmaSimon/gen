# Gen

Generative art projects. Excuse the mess, most of the code doesn't or can't follow good coding practices because 1) processing is annoying (thanks love you tho), and 2) I don't care, I just want to get my idea working as fast as possible and not have to mess with Java for 5 hours. But hopefully as I build up tooling I can get faster and clean things up a bit.

## Processing

### Java

```fish
cd processing_java
scripts/clone control plotter/newPlotterProject
cd sketches/plotter/newPlotterProject
ls -la
```

Some useful plotter tools exist in `processing_java/tools`.

All my processing sketches exist in `processing_java/sketches`. `plotter` contains sketches that generate (usually monochrome) SVGs to be plotted, `genuary+` contains some projects I worked on for genuary 2021, and a handful of other half finished things from before I set up my plotter.
