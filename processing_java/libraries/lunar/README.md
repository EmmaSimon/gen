# Lunar for Processing

### What is Lunar?
Lunar is a lightweight parametric design library for the minimalist, inspired on existing node-based plug-ins for CAD software. She holds algorithms for the easy generation and adaptation of polygon meshes, vectors and list patterns. She has a built-in interactive camera and additional renderer extensions.

## Example

```
import lunar.*;

void setup() {
  size(800, 800, P3D);
}

void draw(){
  background(230);

  Render.mouseCamera(this, new LVector(), 300);
  LMesh mesh = Meshes.boxMesh(100, 100, 100, 5, 5, 5);
  Render.mesh(this, mesh);
}
```

### Why use Lunar?
Lunar is meant for architects, designers and artists that don't want to learn multiple, complex, libraries to visualize their three-dimensional concepts. Lunar has all the building blocks for fast sketching in three dimensions.

### How to work with Lunar?
Lunar groups her algorithms under several classes:
- Vector
  - Vector calculation
  - Vector field generation
- Meshes
  - Mesh generation
- Lists
  - List adaptations
  - Pattern generation
- Render
  - Object drawing
  - Camera

The methods are static and can be called directly from the class.
```
Render.gradientBackground(this, color(0), color(230));
```

Each method, except the render methods, return an object. To modify an object, you should replace the original with the result of the method.
```
LVector v = new LVector(0,4,2);
v = Vectors.unitVector(v);
```
